# 3js-test1
A bare bones basic three js test loading a blender exported .glb file.

This is an initial first test for Tre, seeing if we can simply and easilly export a .glb file of his KCC campus buildings exported from Blender.

External dependencies:
* Three.js (main 3D js library)
* GLTFLoader (to load .glb file)
* Orbot Controls (to rotate the 3D model)
